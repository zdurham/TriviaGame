# Japanese Film Trivia
This is a game built using jQuery, HTML, and CSS, and momentJS.

Once the user presses 'Start' on the main page, they will be given a set amount of seconds to answer each trivia question.

If the user times out, they are shown the correct answer and move on to the next question. The same process happens if they are incorrect or guess the correct answer.

The application tracks the number of correct/incorrect responses and questions that timed out. The user is shown their totals at the end of the quiz. From there, the user can opt to play again.
